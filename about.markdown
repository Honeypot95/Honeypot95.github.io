Hi! I am Iulian Birlica! Welcome to my personal website!

I consider myself a computer scientist. The scientist part is important. I do
not have a particular favorite subfield in computer science. I like the problem
solving aspect of computer science, and there are different peoblems to be
solved in every field.

I believe education is obligatory. If you learn something, you have to teach it
to other people. Not everybody will do this, but the few that do carry the
weight of humanity further. You will see some educational specific content here.

I like mathematics, but I did not study past computer science undergraduate
level math. I particularly like infinitesimal analysis, and I regularly solve
Romanian calculus olympiad problems here. I think infinitesimal analysis is much
more intuitive and could help more people dwelve more into math, and it is a
shame it is not the main method of teaching. I solve some problems here, as a
way to contribute.

I like writing poetry, particularly using constrained writing techniques. You
can check out some of that here as well.

In principle I like sports, such as swimming, tennis and squash, but I am not
very good at them. I hope to change this in the near future.
